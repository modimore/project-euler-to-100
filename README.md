This repo contains solutions to Project Euler problems 1-100. Project Euler generally accepts solutions and discussion of problems 1-100 to be available online, and I respect that so I will not post any answers for problems byond that. I have a solution for each problem in Python, and sometimes another language if I felt like it might be interesting or I could express a solution very differently in that language.

I was solving this range of problems first in 2018-2020. Solutions should use only the standard library of the language and my own helpers and utilities which are included near the solutions in this repo. Generally these are not meant to be particular about language version either, but in case it matters I have been running these with Python 3.7 and Java 11. Basically targetting a reasonable basically out-of-the-box Linux distro from 2019 (Debian Buster) on a relatively old and modest machine. My standard for solution speed is vaguely "fast enough that I am willing to wait for the program to run" in that environment.

I have put these in a public repo for a friend. To that friend, but also any general audience who reads this, I encourage you to give a good-spirited attempt at each problem on your own prior to looking at my or anyone else's solution.
